# Angular Responsive SPA Dashboard Framework

This project is a sample responsive SPA framework. It is a feature-rich menu system with menus, dashboards and widgets. Anfular-dridster was used to create a dashboard and widget system. All the components are packaged using Gulp so they can be used in any Angular application.

### Running the application:

Navigate to the project folder where you can see index.html, run 'lite-server' and your browser should automatically pop up the page. If you haven't installed lite-server yet, just run `sudo npm install lite-server -g`.

An alternative I provided is running the command `node app.js`.
